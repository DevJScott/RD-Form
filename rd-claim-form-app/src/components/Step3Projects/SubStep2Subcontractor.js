        The rules around claiming R&D tax relief while acting as a subcontractor can be complex.
        The questions in this section will help to establish how much work{" "}
        <strong>{formData.companyName || "PLAYCRAFT LTD"}</strong> did as a subcontractor,
        and whether it can claim for the costs of this work.

        Between <strong>01 October 2023</strong> and <strong>30 September 2024</strong>, did{" "}
        <strong>{formData.companyName || "PLAYCRAFT LTD"}</strong> work as a subcontractor to other companies?
